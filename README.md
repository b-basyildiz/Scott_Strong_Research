# Scott_Strong_Research

1. This research is completed in collaboration with Professor Scott Strong at the Colorado School of Mines. This project tries to use curvature and torsion to generate graphs that represent the vortex lines of systems. Then using these vector lines we would be numerically able to genreate vector fields for a variety of curvature and torsion inputs
2. A significant amount of the code is purely based on testing the application of a numerical generator for a vortex line. 
3. This research is done in collaboration with the Scott Strong research team, and I the code is purely my own (Bora Basyildlz)
